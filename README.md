# Project: Tic-Tac-Toe
This project is a simple implementation of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game using HTML, CSS (TailwindCSS with DaisyUI), and JavaScript. <br><br> The game allows two players to take turns marking spaces on a 3x3 grid with their respective symbols (X or O) until one player wins or the game ends in a tie.

## Getting Started
To get started with the project, you can simply check out [this link](https://kronjuvel1.github.io/project-tictactoe/) or clone the repository to your local machine:

## Project Structure
The project structure follows the principles of modular JavaScript, with functionality divided into logical components:

- Gameboard Object: Stores the game state as an array representing the board.
- Player Objects: Represent the players in the game.
- Game Object: Controls the flow of the game, including checking for winning conditions and ties.
<br> 
The code is organized to minimize the use of global variables and follows the module pattern to encapsulate functionality where possible.

## Development Process
1. Console Game: Initially, the focus was on creating a working game logic in the console, implementing win and tie conditions.
2. Display Logic: Once the console game was functional, an object handling display and DOM logic was created.
3. DOM Interaction: Functions were written to allow players to interact with the game board on the webpage, preventing moves in occupied spots.
4. Interface Improvements: The interface was enhanced to include player name input, a game start/restart button, and a display element showing game results.
